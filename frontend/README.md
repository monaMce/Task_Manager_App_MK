# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Frontend Updates:
8/27 - the initial page loads with all of your tasks and then filters when you select a specific date; if you add a new task, it will automatically add it 
        to the filtered page (whether or not it is for that date) and you will have to refilter to get the final view
